# JavaProgrammingProjects
Programming projects created utilizing Java. This repository contains personal projects and projects related to courses completed.
Credit to professors for ideas and partners in certain projects. 

## Projects
1. NearestNeighbor: Utilizing a binary search tree and a point object, locate the nearest neighbor (point) to another point.
2. QueueProcessScheduling: Project that attempts to emulate the process scheduler for a single thread in an operating system.
3. SpacePirate: Simple game where the user is in a spaceship and attempts to navigate a field of asteroids onto landing pads. 
4. Hangman: Hangman game that has the ability to cheat and change the word being guessed until only 20% of the total words remain in                   the program's dictionary.
5. GuessingGame: Program that attempts to guess the animal a user is thinking of by asking questions until either the correct animal is                    guessed or the program gets the animal wrong and then records the user's answer, essentially 'learning' and saving the                    knowledge for later playthroughs. This program is implemented utilizing a tree.
6. SortingArrays: Implementations of staple algorithms for sorting arrays such as selectionSort, insertionSort, mergeSort, and quickSort.
7. GuessingGame (Bag based): Guessing game exploring the properties of the bag data structure where the user attempts to guess all the numbers contained within a bag with a limited number of tries.
8. LISP Expression Evaluator: This program takes in a LISP expression and evaluates the answer. This process involves rearranging the LISP                               expression to be in postfix notation, and then evaluating the final answer using stacks. 
9. Bioinformatics: Program that determines the longest common subsequence between two strands of DNA and two strands of RNA.
10. 2DArraySearchAlgorithms: Project that explores alternate ways to search a 2D array in more efficient manner compared to a linear                                    search.
