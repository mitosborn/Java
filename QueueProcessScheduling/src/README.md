# Description
This project attempts to emulate a task scheduler for a single threaded CPU. It utilizes a queue data structure and keeps track of the time each process should begin along with how long it needs to run for. This project was very interesting for the insights it gave into a major component of operating systems being the task scheduler. Looking to the future, it would be interesting to try and emulate a multithreaded task scheduler. This project would be much more complex; however, utilizing the lessons learned during this project, it should be easier.
